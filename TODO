- Proper build solution:
  - use config.h
  - detect if lm_sensors is available and add `-DHAVE_SENSORS` and `-lsensors`
  - make it possible to change the configuration path at build time

- src/optparse/
  - It works, but isn't finished yet

- doc/*
  - Is currently autogenerated by argparse-tool and looks ugly
